# Riot-API-Project
The purpose of this independent project is to learn how to utilize API in Python to populate an Excel spreadsheet and turn them into data visualizations through tools like Tableau to showcase my findings.
By using the [Riot Games API](https://developer.riotgames.com/), specifically the League of Legends API, I used multiple endpoints to create a program that allows me to find data about what roles, lanes, and champions League of Legends players in the challenger tier mostly use.
Through this statistics and visualizations, players can learn about some of the factors that allows challenger players to succeed and implement those changes into their own playstyles which can promote self-growth.
At the end of my program, I wrote a Python function that allows me to turn the output into an Excel file which I can use to create graphs and visualizations. Currently, I am still working on my Tableau dashboard to display my findings.
